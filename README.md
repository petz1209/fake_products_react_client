### about

micro frontend to practice development for big data CRUD UI's


### Libraries

- react  create-react-app  -> this should probably be adjusted to vite or so
- ag-grid


### current problems

I think the git repo should actually start at the frontend folder and not above.
however I did not have the time to clean this up yet. Will do at some point

### todo's


- [x] create a ag-grid phasade
- [x] create form that derives state from selected table row
- [x] create update and insert methods on Form
- [x] hookup backend so update and insert actually happen
- [ ] inject updated / created information into <Table /> without rerendering the entire component
